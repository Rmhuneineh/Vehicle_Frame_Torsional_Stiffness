# Vehicle_Frame_Torsional_Stiffness
In this work, the evaluation of the torsional stiffness of a frame composed of four thin-walled beams is presented. The longitudinal beams have a circular cross-section while the cross beams have a rectangular cross-section. The evaluation is performed analytically and numerically on a set of combinations between open and closed cross- section beams using two different load configurations and two types of meshing elements. Results have shown that a configuration with all closed cross-section beams has the highest torsional stiffness while the one with all open cross-section beams has a drastically lower value. The other two combinations have a torsional stiffness that lies somewhere between these two extremes with the one composed of longitudinal beams with closed cross-section having a higher value due to its circular cross-section.
